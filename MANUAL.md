# Mica Manual

## Overview

Mica stands for Miranda Cat and is inspired by the Canon Cat, Helix, acme, AMP, and Emacs. It pairs a Go TUI frontend (tcell) with a headless editing core, focusing on fast “Leap” navigation, multi-buffer workflows, and keyboard-centric shortcuts.

The headless editor now uses a gap-buffer-backed text model for editing performance; app/runtime code reads text via `Runes()`/`String()` and length via `RuneLen()`.

## Launching

```sh
go build -o mica .
./mica [file1 file2 ...]
```

- Passing existing files opens each in its own buffer.
- Missing filenames open empty buffers with that path; the file is created on first save.
- `Ctrl+B` creates a new `<untitled>` buffer; name it on save via the input line.

## Navigation & Selection

- **Leap (case-insensitive):** currently unbound in TUI mode.
- **Leap Again:** not currently mapped in TUI mode.
- **Selection while leaping:** available via the editor selection model; terminal mappings focus on reliable single-modifier input.
- **Arrows / PageUp / PageDown:** Move or select with Shift.
- **Page scroll shortcuts:** `Ctrl+,` pages up and `Ctrl+.` pages down (Shift extends selection).
- **Line start/end:** `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+E` (Shift extends selection).
- **Buffer start/end:** `Ctrl+Shift+A` / `Ctrl+Shift+E`.
- **Line jump assist:** Current line is highlighted; line numbers are shown in a gutter.

## Editing

- **Insert:** Normal typing; Enter inserts newline; double-space inserts a tab at line start.
- **Delete:** `Backspace` deletes backward; `Delete` removes the word under/left of the caret; `Shift+Delete` removes the current line.
- **Kill to EOL:** `Ctrl+K` deletes to end of line (and newline if not last line).
- **Undo:** `Ctrl+U` (single-step).
- **Comment toggle:** `Ctrl+/` toggles `//` on selection or current line.
- **Clipboard:** `Ctrl+C` copy, `Ctrl+X` cut, `Ctrl+V` paste.
- **Go autocompletion:** In Go buffers, `Tab` first performs deterministic completion for unique keywords and unique imported package-name prefixes. For selector completion (`pkg.` / `pkg.pref`), it opens a chooser popup with `gopls` candidates and signatures.
- **Go symbol info:** `Esc` then `i` toggles a popup with information about the symbol under cursor (keywords/builtins with usage examples, local definitions, and hover text when available). `Esc` closes the popup; `Up/Down`, `PageUp/PageDown`, `Home/End` scroll long content.
- **Completion details popup:** While the selector completion popup is open, pausing on a candidate briefly opens an upper-right detail popup with description and formatted code examples.
- **Esc command mode:** `Esc` is a command prefix for control-style actions (`Esc+f`, `Esc+Shift+S`, `Esc+Shift+Q`, `Esc+i`, `Esc+Esc`).
- **Esc delayed help popup:** If `Esc` stays pending for a short delay, a lower-right popup appears showing grouped `Esc` commands by next letter (no `Ctrl+...` entries).
- **Search mode:** `Esc+/` enters incremental search. Type the pattern (caret jumps to full matches while typing), then press `/` to lock the pattern. While locked, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` move to next/previous match with wrap. If the current pattern is empty when `/` is pressed, the editor reuses the last non-empty search pattern and jumps to the next match. Any other key exits search and performs its normal action; `x` exits search and enters line-highlight mode.
- **Line highlight mode:** `Esc+X` starts line highlighting from the current line. Press `x` repeatedly to extend selection by one line each time. `Esc` exits this mode.
- **Buffer clear:** `Esc+Shift+Delete` clears the entire active buffer.
- **Language mode cycle:** `Esc+M` cycles active buffer language mode (`text -> go -> markdown -> c -> miranda -> text`), including untitled buffers.
- **Less mode:** `Esc+Space` enters paging mode; `Space` pages forward and `Esc` exits less mode.

## Go Completion Details

- **Activation:** Completion runs only in Go mode (`lang=go` in status line).
- **Engine:** The editor starts `gopls` lazily and communicates over LSP.
- **When it updates:** Pressing `Tab` in a Go buffer triggers completion for the token under the caret.
- **Fast paths:** Unique Go keyword prefixes complete before any `gopls` request (for example, `pack` -> `package`), and unique imported package prefixes complete directly (for example, `fm` -> `fmt` when `fmt` is imported).
- **Selector chooser:** For `pkg.` or `pkg.pref`, `Tab` opens a chooser popup; use `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` or `Up/Down` to select, `Enter` to apply, `Esc` to cancel.
- **Details popup:** If selection stays idle briefly, a second popup appears with signature/docs/examples for the selected candidate.
- **Failure mode:** If `gopls` is unavailable or fails, selector popup completion is disabled for that session; the editor remains fully usable.
- **Fallback mode:** Without `gopls`, `Tab` still performs deterministic Go keyword/import-prefix completion when a unique match exists.
- **Limitations (current):**
  - Go-only completion
  - Popup chooser currently targets selector-style completion (`pkg.`)
  - Snippet placeholders are flattened to plain text
  - Detail popup quality depends on docs returned by `gopls`

## Buffers & Files

- **New / cycle buffers:** `Ctrl+B` creates `<untitled>`; `Shift+Tab` cycles.
- **File picker:** `Ctrl+O` opens a picker buffer rooted at the current directory; entries start with `..` to go up. Move the caret to a line and press `Ctrl+L` to open; directories open in-place; files open in new buffers or switch if already loaded.
- **Write/save-as:** `Esc+W` opens the write prompt for the active buffer. Type a path and press Enter to save.
- **Save + fmt/fix + reload:** `Esc+F` saves current file, runs `go fmt` and `go fix` in the file's directory package context, then reloads the file into the current buffer.
- **Run package:** `Ctrl+R` invokes `go run .` in the active file's directory and opens a run-output buffer. It writes the executed command header first, streams stdout/stderr (`[stderr]`-prefixed), then appends an `[exit]` result line.
- **Save dirty buffers:** `Esc+Shift+S` saves only buffers marked dirty.
- **Close buffer / quit:** `Ctrl+Q` closes the current buffer; `Esc+Shift+Q` quits. `Esc` is a command prefix; press `Esc` then `Esc` to close the current buffer.

## Status & Input Lines

- **Status (above input):** Shows buffer name, mode (Leap/Edit/Open), language mode (`lang=text|go|markdown|c|miranda`), cwd, `*unsaved*` marker, and last event.
- **Input (bottom):** Used for prompts (e.g., Save as). Type to respond; Enter confirms; Esc cancels.
  - In Go mode, if caret is on a syntax-error line, this line shows the current parser error in red.

## Syntax Highlighting

- Pure-Go Tree-sitter highlighting (`gotreesitter`) is enabled with no CGO dependency for:
  - Go (`.go` or first non-empty line starting with `package `)
  - Markdown (`.md` / `.markdown`)
  - C (`.c` / `.h`)
  - Miranda (`.m`)

## Go Syntax Check

- In Go mode, source is parsed with Go's parser (`parser.AllErrors`).
- Any line with a parse error is marked with a red gutter indicator.
- When caret is on an error line, the bottom input/info line shows that specific error in red.
- Syntax checking is disabled for non-Go buffers.

## Tips & Examples

- **Jump around text:** leap remains available in editor core, but is currently unbound in TUI mode.
- **Indent quickly:** Press space twice on a line to insert a tab at its start.
- **Open by pattern:** `Ctrl+O`, type a few letters to filter/select the filename, `Ctrl+L` to open. Use `..` to go up a directory.
- **Save unnamed buffer:** `Esc+W`, type `notes/todo.txt` in the input line, Enter — file is created and saved, buffer is renamed.
- **Multiple files:** `./mica file1.txt dir/file2.txt` opens two buffers; `Shift+Tab` cycles.
